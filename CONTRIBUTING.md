You're going to need to have those things installed to contribute to this project.

1. Fork the repo.
2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. Create a branch for your fix : `git checkout -b branch-name-here`.
4. Run `yarn install`.
5. Create `.env.development` file in main dir.
6. Check `.env.example` file and copy everything over there to `.env.development` file.
7. This project uses [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) for searching blogs. So, you must put api keys that algolia gives you in `.env.development` file. Check this docs on  [Configuring Algolia plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-search-with-algolia/#configuring-the-algolia-plugin).
8. Run `gatsby develop` command.
