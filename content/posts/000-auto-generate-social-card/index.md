So, few months back I was building my [portfolio site](http://adarshaacharya.com.np/) which you are in right now. Everything was completed, build blog sections add some SEO stuffs \*_(although I'm very bad at it)._ Deployed site and when I want to share it to twitter. Surprisingly, I can't see any preview over there just a blank link with some description over there. I thought Twitter would automatically generate social cards for my site ðŸ¤ª.

I used to see [dev.to](https://dev.to/) articles quite often shared quite often on social media, with similar kinda' social card with those author name title social media links and all kinds of stuff.

Hmmm.. then I started looking at some Gatsby plugins, I found some good ones but I didn't really like them tbh. They require a lot of configuration which I didn't want to do. I was searching for the plugin with minimum configuraion and you are good to go ! ðŸš€ðŸ”¥

Then I saw tweet which actually address my problem and he recommend we this [awesome plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jlengstorf/get-share-image) . Although Jason has awesome [article](https://www.learnwithjason.dev/blog/auto-generate-social-image/) regarding building this plugin but I wanna share my experience how I integrate it in my site especially where I have to address two big things :

- Generate social cards for website pages like home, contact
- Generate social cards for blog pages that means I have to generate title dynamically for each pages.

## Before we start..

Before we get started we need to setup just few things:

> ðŸš¨ Signup for Cloudinary account [with this link](https://jason.af/cloudinary). â€” It's absoultely free , and will also help creator of package that we are going to use.

We are going to use package [`get-share-image`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jlengstorf/get-share-image) to generate the social cards using Cloudinary API.

## Installation

First let's install the required packages.

```bash
# install using npm
npm install --save @jlengstorf/get-share-image

# install using yarn
yarn add @jlengstorf/get-share-image
```

You must also install [react-helmet](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet/#install) as we will be injecting cards as Seo using this plugin.

> We will be using Gatsby site as the example in this project you can use it with CRA or in Next.js site too.
> You can see the the example used in [this site source code](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/adarshaacharya.com.np/blob/master/src/components/Seo/Seo.js) and follow along.

## Usage

Now you must ahve the cloudinary name which is the username you entered while creating account. Check that by going to [Console](https://cloudinary.com/console) of cloudinary account. I prefer to put it as env variables by there is no harm in exposing to the user.

Now go to media library section, create directory named `portfolio` and upload the cover photo and name it `website-card` _(convention)_. You can use the same photo for blog too but we are going to upload next one with and name it `blog-card` _(convention)_.

My cover photo looks something like this : ðŸ‘‡
![Website Card](website-card.png)

I recommend you to put much blank as possible with some social link so that there will be ample space for text.

In the file where you put all your SEO objects *(commonly Seo.js)*import the hooks provided by package and pass object as parameter.

### Social Card for Website Pages

At first we are going to create social image for overall website so,

```js
import getShareImage from '@jlengstorf/get-share-image';

const socialImage = getShareImage({
  title: 'Aadarsha Acharya',

  cloudName: 'YOUR_CLOUDINARY_NAME',

  imagePublicID: 'portfolio/website-card',

  font: 'futura',

  textColor: '232129',
});
```

It will return the URL of website-card for the website pages.

You can modify and add the above properties by checking the [options in the docs](https://github.com/jlengstorf/get-share-image#options) , I've added a bit more in my site[check source code here](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/adarshaacharya.com.np/blob/c229d6341ae76d0c49b5cd6e969640aee44e799c/src/components/Seo/Seo.js#L15).

## Social Card for Blog Post

For individual blog post we are going to create another variable to store the url for the blog-post .Lets write code for that too.

```js
const socialImage = getShareImage({
  title: metaTitle,

  tagline: metaKeywords.map(tag => `#${tag}`).join(' '),

  cloudName: 'YOUR_CLOUDINARY_NAME',

  imagePublicID: 'portfolio/blog-card',

  font: 'futura',

  textColor: '232129',
});
```

You can modify and add the above properties by checking the [options in the docs](https://github.com/jlengstorf/get-share-image#options) , I've added a bit more in my site check [source code here](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/adarshaacharya.com.np/blob/c229d6341ae76d0c49b5cd6e969640aee44e799c/src/components/Seo/Seo.js#L31).

> You have notice two major object properties in above code that's title and tagline. What's that ? ðŸ¤”
> These are dynamically generated tags & title for each blog post. Honestly, I've to make new post regarding SEO using Helmet which isn't possible in this post. You can check [source code](https://github.com/adarshaacharya/adarshaacharya.com.np/blob/c229d6341ae76d0c49b5cd6e969640aee44e799c/src/components/Seo/Seo.js) I'm pretty sure you will get it. ðŸ§

## Rendering Cards Conditionally

Pass `isBlogPost={true}` or `isBlogPost={false}` as props to SEO component from every component that's using `Seo.js`.

Inside `Seo` functional component check the below condition to choose which card to use between blogPostCard or websiteCard:

```js
const socialImage = isBlogPost ? blogPostCard : websiteCard;
```

---

## Almost done

Now use it everywhere you can ðŸ˜¹ ðŸ˜¹ _(joking)_. Pass the following props in the Helmet component.

```jsx
<Helmet
  meta={[
    {
      name: `image`,
      content: socialImage,
    },
    {
      property: `og:image`,
      content: socialImage,
    },
    {
      name: 'twitter:image',
      content: socialImage,
    },
  ]}
/>
```

This will inject the card images as the content in meta tags we are done !

Test the above work by deploying the site in production environment _( this won't work in dev environment)._
