## Why and what React js?

> A quick introduction to the popular JavaScript library.


With the front-end world changing on a daily basis, it’s hard to devote time to learning a new framework — especially when that framework could ultimately become a dead end. So, if you’re looking for the next best thing but you’re feeling a little bit lost in the framework jungle, I suggest checking out React. This Blog gives you a basic understanding of React js.


ReactJS basically is an open-source JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces specifically for single page applications. It’s used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps. React also allows us to create reusable UI components.


React allows developers to create large web applications which can change data, without reloading the page. The main purpose of React is to be fast, scalable, and simple. It works only on user interfaces in application. This corresponds to view in the MVC template.


## What are the ReactJS Features?

-   JSX
-   React Native
-   Single-Way data flow
-   Virtual Document Object Model
-   Component Based
-   Declarative


JSX: In React, instead of using regular JavaScript for templating, it uses JSX. JSX is simple JavaScript which allows HTML quoting and uses these HTML tag syntax to render subcomponents.
React Native: React has native libraries which were announced by Facebook in 2015, which provides the react architecture to native applications like IOS and Android.


Single-Way data flow: In React, a set of immutable values are passed to the components renderer as properties in its HTML tags. Component cannot directly modify any properties but can pass a call back function with help of which we can do modifications.


Virtual Document Object Model: In React, for every DOM object, there is a corresponding “virtual DOM object.” A virtual DOM object is a representation of a DOM object, it creates a virtual copy of the original DOM. It’s a one-way data binding hence manipulating the virtual DOM is quick rather than updating original DOM.


**Component Based:** In React everything is component the web page divided into small components to create a view(or UIs). Every part of applications visuals would be wrapped inside a self-contained module known as a component. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.

Components in ReactJS use to define the visuals and interactions in applications.
Declarative: React creates very interactive and dynamic user interface for websites and mobile applications. Create simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more readable and easier to debug.

## Why React Js?
Now, the main question arises is why one should use ReactJS. There are so many open-source platforms for making the front-end web application development easier, like Angular. Let us take a quick look on the benefits of React over other competitive technologies or frameworks.
Simplicity
ReactJS is just simpler to grasp right away. The component-based approach, well-defined lifecycle, and use of just plain JavaScript make React very simple to learn, build a professional web (and mobile applications). React uses a special syntax called JSX which allows you to mix HTML with JavaScript.
Easy to learn

> Anyone with a basic previous knowledge in programming can easily understand React, you just need basic knowledge of CSS and HTML.

### Native Approach
React can be used to create mobile applications (React Native). And React is a diehard fan of reusability, meaning extensive code reusability is supported. So at the same time we can make IOS, Android and Web application.


### Data Binding
React uses one-way data binding and an application architecture called Flux controls the flow of data to components through one control point the dispatcher. It’s easier to debug self-contained components of large ReactJS apps.


### Performance
React does not offer any concept of a built-in container for dependency. You can use Browserify, Require JS, EcmaScript 6 modules which we can use via Babel to inject dependencies automatically.


```js

console.log("Hello world")
```

### Testability
ReactJS applications are super easy to test. React views can be treated as functions of the state, so we can manipulate with state we pass to the ReactJS view and take a look at the output and triggered actions, events, functions, etc.
