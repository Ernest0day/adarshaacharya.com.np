### Introduction
Many new features for working with arrays and objects have been made available to the JavaScript language since the 2015 Edition of the ECMAScript specification. A few of the notable ones that you will learn in this article are destructuring, rest parameters, and spread syntax. These features provide more direct ways of accessing the members of an array or an object, and can make working with these data structures quicker and more succinct.

Many other languages do not have corresponding syntax for destructuring, rest parameters, and spread, so these features may have a learning curve both for new JavaScript developers and those coming from another language. In this article, you will learn how to destructure objects and arrays, how to use the spread operator to unpack objects and arrays, and how to use rest parameters in function calls.

```jsx
console.log("Hello World");
```

## Default NodeJS server

```jsx
const http = require('http');

const hostname = '127.0.0.1';
const port = 3000;

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```
